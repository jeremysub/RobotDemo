- forward n - move forward n spaces
- backward n - move backward n spaces
- turn left - turn left 90 degrees
- turn right - turn right 90 degrees
- center - move to the center of the grid

## Response Format

Please return your commands in JSON format as follows:

    "commands": [
        "forward 4",
        "turn right",
        "forward 2",
        "turn left",
        "forward 1"
    ]
}
